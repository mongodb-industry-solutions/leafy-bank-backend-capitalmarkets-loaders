Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury sees promise in stablecoin legislation, and the Supreme Court has rejected Coinbase's attempt to block IRS access to user data. U.S. markets are hitting record highs, with S&P 500 futures showing strength. In the mining sector, BitMine is making a significant $250M investment in Ethereum. The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale's filing for a multi-crypto ETF, potentially opening doors for broader crypto investment options. These developments signal growing mainstream acceptance and regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies.\n\n# XRP Ledger Launches Ethereum Sidechain, Bridging Two Major Blockchain Ecosystems\n\nXRP Ledger's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain has launched on mainnet, enabling interoperability between XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This development allows XRP to interact with Ethereum-based decentralized applications, boosting XRPL's capabilities.\n\n# Robinhood Shakes Up Finance with Stock Tokens, Blockchain, and Expanded Crypto Suite\n\nRobinhood Markets is revolutionizing its platform with the launch of stock tokens for European customers, allowing trading of over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs as digital tokens. The company is also developing its own Layer 2 blockchain and expanding crypto offerings, including perpetual futures and staking, in both EU and US markets.\n\n# MicroStrategy Doubles Down: $531M Bitcoin Buy Signals Bullish Outlook\n\nMicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has purchased 4,980 Bitcoin for $531.9 million at an average price of $106,801 per BTC. This aggressive acquisition brings their total holdings to 597,325 BTC, worth approximately $42.4 billion, demonstrating strong long-term confidence in Bitcoin's potential.\n\n# Fed Chair Replacement Search and Stablecoin Legislation: Major Changes Ahead for U.S. Monetary Policy and Crypto\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent announces the search for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's replacement is underway, signaling potential shifts in U.S. monetary policy. Bessent also reveals that stablecoin legislation could be finalized by mid-July, potentially increasing demand for U.S. Treasuries and impacting the crypto industry.\n\n# Supreme Court Allows IRS Access to Coinbase User Data, Raising Crypto Privacy Concerns\n\nThe US Supreme Court rejected Coinbase's attempt to block the IRS from accessing user data, allowing the tax agency to obtain transaction information for over 14,000 cryptocurrency customers. This decision puts crypto privacy under pressure and highlights increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\n# Metaplanet Boosts Bitcoin Holdings, Joins Top 5 Holders as Stock Soars\n\nJapanese company Metaplanet increases Bitcoin holdings to 13,350 coins by acquiring 1,005 more BTC, entering top 5 Bitcoin holders list.

  "selftext": "TLDR: Just got into investing a few months ago. Even if I’m risk-tolerant, is it silly to allocate \\~10% of my portfolio to stocks that I picked myself?\n\nI’m 24M with a stable job, low expenses; higher risk profile than most. Trying to make the most of the situation by investing as much as possible for long-term growth.\n\nI read that a core-satellite portfolio is a decent strategy, where you have a lower-risk, diversified core position and a higher-risk/speculative satellite position. I decided on a 70/25/5 split of core/sattelite/crypto. I invested a lot lump-sum, then wised up and set up automations to DCA a good chunk of my paycheck into this portfolio every month (around $3,000 invested per month). I have \\~$40k in my investment portfolio right now; haven’t really touched it but I’m considering rebalancing.\n\nHere’s the high-level breakdown:\n\nCore (70%): Maxing out a Roth IRA investing into FZROX. The rest of the 70% goes into VTI, in a normal brokerage account.\n\nSatellite (25%): Around 50% in tech/growth-based ETFs, the rest in individual stock picks. I work in tech (big data), so most of my picks are fairly speculative tech stocks, like cloud computing, aerospace, AI, quantum, etc. My analysis was super basic; I just picked small-med size companies in sectors that I can see growing in the next 10, 20, 30+ years, based on my own personal experience.\n\nCrypto (5%): Mainly BTC/ETH; I see a lot of growth potential because I can see crypto becoming more widely used as my generation comes into wealth. This is something I truly believe in and I’m not willing to budge on (other than rebalancing for risk management, if needed).\n\n\n\nI have a few specific questions:\n\n1. If you were in my position, would you keep that \\~10% invested in individual stock picks? If not, how would you reallocate?\n\n2. Am I right in my analysis that investing in those more volatile/speculative stocks will generally decrease the expected return on my investment (i.e., it won’t outperform the market), while increasing the overall volatility of my portfolio?\n\n3. Is time horizon a factor? E.g., if I held those speculative stocks for 10, 20, 30+ years, would that investment then become more valuable than throwing it all into VTI or QQQ, for example? Just for the chance of hitting a moonshot?",

Even if I’m risk-tolerant, is it silly to allocate \\~10% of my portfolio to stocks that I picked myself?\n\nI’m 24M with a stable job, low expenses; higher risk profile than most. Trying to make the most of the situation by investing as much as possible for long-term growth.\n\nI read that a core-satellite portfolio is a decent strategy, where you have a lower-risk, diversified core position and a higher-risk/speculative satellite position. I decided on a 70/25/5 split of core/sattelite/crypto. I invested a lot lump-sum, then wised up and set up automations to DCA a good chunk of my paycheck into this portfolio every month (around $3,000 invested per month). I have \\~$40k in my investment portfolio right now; haven’t really touched it but I’m considering rebalancing.\n\nHere’s the high-level breakdown:\n\nCore (70%): Maxing out a Roth IRA investing into FZROX. The rest of the 70% goes into VTI, in a normal brokerage account.\n\nSatellite (25%): Around 50% in tech/growth-based ETFs, the rest in individual stock picks. I work in tech (big data), so most of my picks are fairly speculative tech stocks, like cloud computing, aerospace, AI, quantum, etc. My analysis was super basic; I just picked small-med size companies in sectors that I can see growing in the next 10, 20, 30+ years, based on my own personal experience.\n\nCrypto (5%): Mainly BTC/ETH; I see a lot of growth potential because I can see crypto becoming more widely used as my generation comes into wealth. This is something I truly believe in and I’m not willing to budge on (other than rebalancing for risk management, if needed).\n\n\n\nI have a few specific questions:\n\n1. If you were in my position, would you keep that \\~10% invested in individual stock picks? If not, how would you reallocate?\n\n2. Am I right in my analysis that investing in those more volatile/speculative stocks will generally decrease the expected return on my investment (i.e., it won’t outperform the market), while increasing the overall volatility of my portfolio?\n\n3. Is time horizon a factor? E.g., if I held those speculative stocks for 10, 20, 30+ years, would that investment then become more valuable than throwing it all into VTI or QQQ, for example? Just for the chance of hitting a moonshot?",

It is absolutely difficult to consume from a user experience point of view. \n\nAll the different chains, L2s add more confusment to the users. I even get stuck sometimes. Although there are projects that are trying to simplify the UX experience, we still need more to go.\n\nUrgent changes needed:\n\n1- Interop mass adoption\n\n2- Intent based wallets - with AI\n\n3- EVM to catch SOL on stock trading ( have you seen that yesterday? its crazy?\n\nHuge shoutout to some teams actually tackling these problems in EVM: \n\nInterop/Execution: Biconomy, LayerZero\\_Labs, xelarnetwork, chainlink \n\nIntent-based UX: CowSwap, 1inch, IntentX, anoma \n\nAI/Education: askgina\\_ai, rabbithole\\_gg, thirdweb, alchemy \n\nBut we need 100x more innovation in these areas. \n\nWhat other projects are you bullish on for solving real UX problems?\n\n I'm going ALL IN on teams that prioritize user experience over token pumps for the next 6 months. Because if we don't fix this, Web3 will remain a playground for degens instead of the financial revolution it was meant to be..",
