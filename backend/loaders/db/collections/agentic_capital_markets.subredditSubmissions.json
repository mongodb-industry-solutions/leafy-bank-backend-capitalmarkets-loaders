  "selftext": "I’ve been doing some diligence on Litecoin for a few days now, and I believe it’s extremely undervalued.\n\nIt’s literally a copy of Bitcoin except there will be 84 million coins, but then with lower transaction fees and times.  The hashing algorithm is different, but it doesn’t seem to be in a bad way, just different.\n\nLitecoin has always been referenced as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.  The name is literally telling you it’s Bitcoin light.  The purpose of it is to be more usable for spending - faster transaction times and lower transaction fees than Bitcoin - while you save your Bitcoin for the long-term.\n\nThis is why I believe in Litecoin’s future.  We have seen adoption of Bitcoin to the extent of ETFs, corporate reserves, and government reserves.  The next step for these whales would be to begin using crypto for big deals and transactions.  What better coin to do that with than Litecoin?  As it was designed for such and has the track record to be relied upon.\n\nThe counter-argument to that seems to be that there are newer coins that do this better.  I do not believe this to be the case.  For example, many tout Solana would be better for this purpose, as its transaction time is nearly instant, compared to Litecoin’s ~2.5 minutes.\n\nIt is true Solana is faster, but its network has gone down on several occasions.  Litecoin has never gone down in its history.  Imagine a government or major corporation finally closing a deal, only for the crypto it planned to use to be completely inoperable at that moment.  \n\nThere is also the proof of stake versus proof of work discussion between the two, as well as Solana not being a fair launch as reasons to prefer Litecoin.\n\nAnd then there’s Ethereum, which I don’t believe compares to Litecoin.  They’re not in competition.  Both can succeed and/or both can fail.  Ethereum is a bet on web3, while Litecoin is a bet on peer-to-peer payments becoming more common.\n\nBesides thinking other coins may do what Litecoin does but better, the only other criticism I see is Litecoin’s founder selling his entire position.  However, this was 8 years ago.  He said he did this to make decisions about Litecoin’s future without taking how those decisions would impact price into consideration.  A convenient thing to say when it was at an ATH.  But this was 8 years ago, and the founder is still leading and adding new features like anonymity, so I don’t believe it matters that he sold his position anymore.  He has continued to act in the coin’s best interest, add features, and remain active to date.\n\nAnother common criticism is that it’s just traded sideways for so long.  But I thought past performance is not predictive of future results?  There is still reason for, and the possibility of, big money adoption that I laid out above.  An ETF seems to be on the horizon.  The tech simply works without issue.  The fact that it has traded sideways is an opportunity, not a criticism.\n\nSo I ask, why don’t you invest in Litecoin?  What would you recommend I read to understand why I’m wrong?  I’m truly open to learning and do not claim to be an expert in this stuff.  But after all the research I’ve tried to do on my own so far, I haven’t really been able to convince myself it’s not a good investment.",

  "selftext": "I’ve been doing some diligence on Litecoin for a few days now, and I believe it’s extremely undervalued.\n\nIt’s literally a copy of Bitcoin except there will be 84 million coins, but then with lower transaction fees and times.  The hashing algorithm is different, but it doesn’t seem to be in a bad way, just different.\n\nLitecoin has always been referenced as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.  The name is literally telling you it’s Bitcoin light.  The purpose of it is to be more usable for spending - faster transaction times and lower transaction fees than Bitcoin - while you save your Bitcoin for the long-term.\n\nThis is why I believe in Litecoin’s future.  We have seen adoption of Bitcoin to the extent of ETFs, corporate reserves, and government reserves.  The next step for these whales would be to begin using crypto for big deals and transactions.  What better coin to do that with than Litecoin?  As it was designed for such and has the track record to be relied upon.\n\nThe counter-argument to that seems to be that there are newer coins that do this better.  I do not believe this to be the case.  For example, many tout Solana would be better for this purpose, as its transaction time is nearly instant, compared to Litecoin’s ~2.5 minutes.\n\nIt is true Solana is faster, but its network has gone down on several occasions.  Litecoin has never gone down in its history.  Imagine a government or major corporation finally closing a deal, only for the crypto it planned to use to be completely inoperable at that moment.  \n\nThere is also the proof of stake versus proof of work discussion between the two, as well as Solana not being a fair launch as reasons to prefer Litecoin.\n\nAnd then there’s Ethereum, which I don’t believe compares to Litecoin.  They’re not in competition.  Both can succeed and/or both can fail.  Ethereum is a bet on web3, while Litecoin is a bet on peer-to-peer payments becoming more common.\n\nBesides thinking other coins may do what Litecoin does but better, the only other criticism I see is Litecoin’s founder selling his entire position.  However, this was 8 years ago.  He said he did this to make decisions about Litecoin’s future without taking how those decisions would impact price into consideration.  A convenient thing to say when it was at an ATH.  But this was 8 years ago, and the founder is still leading and adding new features like anonymity, so I don’t believe it matters that he sold his position anymore.  He has continued to act in the coin’s best interest, add features, and remain active to date.\n\nAnother common criticism is that it’s just traded sideways for so long.  But I thought past performance is not predictive of future results?  There is still reason for, and the possibility of, big money adoption that I laid out above.  An ETF seems to be on the horizon.  The tech simply works without issue.  The fact that it has traded sideways is an opportunity, not a criticism.\n\nSo I ask, why don’t you invest in Litecoin?  What would you recommend I read to understand why I’m wrong?  I’m truly open to learning and do not claim to be an expert in this stuff.  But after all the research I’ve tried to do on my own so far, I haven’t really been able to convince myself it’s not a good investment.",

  "selftext": "I’ve been doing some diligence on Litecoin for a few days now, and I believe it’s extremely undervalued.\n\nIt’s literally a copy of Bitcoin except there will be 84 million coins, but then with lower transaction fees and times.  The hashing algorithm is different, but it doesn’t seem to be in a bad way, just different.\n\nLitecoin has always been referenced as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.  The name is literally telling you it’s Bitcoin light.  The purpose of it is to be more usable for spending - faster transaction times and lower transaction fees than Bitcoin - while you save your Bitcoin for the long-term.\n\nThis is why I believe in Litecoin’s future.  We have seen adoption of Bitcoin to the extent of ETFs, corporate reserves, and government reserves.  The next step for these whales would be to begin using crypto for big deals and transactions.  What better coin to do that with than Litecoin?  As it was designed for such and has the track record to be relied upon.\n\nThe counter-argument to that seems to be that there are newer coins that do this better.  I do not believe this to be the case.  For example, many tout Solana would be better for this purpose, as its transaction time is nearly instant, compared to Litecoin’s ~2.5 minutes.\n\nIt is true Solana is faster, but its network has gone down on several occasions.  Litecoin has never gone down in its history.  Imagine a government or major corporation finally closing a deal, only for the crypto it planned to use to be completely inoperable at that moment.  \n\nThere is also the proof of stake versus proof of work discussion between the two, as well as Solana not being a fair launch as reasons to prefer Litecoin.\n\nAnd then there’s Ethereum, which I don’t believe compares to Litecoin.  They’re not in competition.  Both can succeed and/or both can fail.  Ethereum is a bet on web3, while Litecoin is a bet on peer-to-peer payments becoming more common.\n\nBesides thinking other coins may do what Litecoin does but better, the only other criticism I see is Litecoin’s founder selling his entire position.  However, this was 8 years ago.  He said he did this to make decisions about Litecoin’s future without taking how those decisions would impact price into consideration.  A convenient thing to say when it was at an ATH.  But this was 8 years ago, and the founder is still leading and adding new features like anonymity, so I don’t believe it matters that he sold his position anymore.  He has continued to act in the coin’s best interest, add features, and remain active to date.\n\nAnother common criticism is that it’s just traded sideways for so long.  But I thought past performance is not predictive of future results?  There is still reason for, and the possibility of, big money adoption that I laid out above.  An ETF seems to be on the horizon.  The tech simply works without issue.  The fact that it has traded sideways is an opportunity, not a criticism.\n\nSo I ask, why don’t you invest in Litecoin?  What would you recommend I read to understand why I’m wrong?  I’m truly open to learning and do not claim to be an expert in this stuff.  But after all the research I’ve tried to do on my own so far, I haven’t really been able to convince myself it’s not a good investment.",

But I thought past performance is not predictive of future results?  There is still reason for, and the possibility of, big money adoption that I laid out above.  An ETF seems to be on the horizon.  The tech simply works without issue.  The fact that it has traded sideways is an opportunity, not a criticism.\n\nSo I ask, why don’t you invest in Litecoin?  What would you recommend I read to understand why I’m wrong?  I’m truly open to learning and do not claim to be an expert in this stuff.  But after all the research I’ve tried to do on my own so far, I haven’t really been able to convince myself it’s not a good investment.",
  "submission_string": "Title: What Are The Bear Arguments Against Litecoin?\nSelftext: I’ve been doing some diligence on Litecoin for a few days now, and I believe it’s extremely undervalued.\n\nIt’s literally a copy of Bitcoin except there will be 84 million coins, but then with lower transaction fees and times.  The hashing algorithm is different, but it doesn’t seem to be in a bad way, just different.\n\nLitecoin has always been referenced as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.  The name is literally telling you it’s Bitcoin light.  The purpose of it is to be more usable for spending - faster transaction times and lower transaction fees than Bitcoin - while you save your Bitcoin for the long-term.\n\nThis is why I believe in Litecoin’s future.  We have seen adoption of Bitcoin to the extent of ETFs, corporate reserves, and government reserves.  The next step for these whales would be to begin using crypto for big deals and transactions.  What better coin to do that with than Litecoin?  As it was designed for such and has the track record to be relied upon.\n\nThe counter-argument to that seems to be that there are newer coins that do this better.  I do not believe this to be the case.  For example, many tout Solana would be better for this purpose, as its transaction time is nearly instant, compared to Litecoin’s ~2.5 minutes.\n\nIt is true Solana is faster, but its network has gone down on several occasions.  Litecoin has never gone down in its history.  Imagine a government or major corporation finally closing a deal, only for the crypto it planned to use to be completely inoperable at that moment.  \n\nThere is also the proof of stake versus proof of work discussion between the two, as well as Solana not being a fair launch as reasons to prefer Litecoin.\n\nAnd then there’s Ethereum, which I don’t believe compares to Litecoin.  They’re not in competition.  Both can succeed and/or both can fail.  Ethereum is a bet on web3, while Litecoin is a bet on peer-to-peer payments becoming more common.\n\nBesides thinking other coins may do what Litecoin does but better, the on\nSubreddit: r/CryptoCurrency\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lnt6ck/what_are_the_bear_arguments_against_litecoin/\nRelated to: USDC\nSubreddit query performed: 'stablecoin OR stable coin'",

  "selftext": "I’ve been doing some diligence on Litecoin for a few days now, and I believe it’s extremely undervalued.\n\nIt’s literally a copy of Bitcoin except there will be 84 million coins, but then with lower transaction fees and times.  The hashing algorithm is different, but it doesn’t seem to be in a bad way, just different.\n\nLitecoin has always been referenced as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.  The name is literally telling you it’s Bitcoin light.  The purpose of it is to be more usable for spending - faster transaction times and lower transaction fees than Bitcoin - while you save your Bitcoin for the long-term.\n\nThis is why I believe in Litecoin’s future.  We have seen adoption of Bitcoin to the extent of ETFs, corporate reserves, and government reserves.  The next step for these whales would be to begin using crypto for big deals and transactions.  What better coin to do that with than Litecoin?  As it was designed for such and has the track record to be relied upon.\n\nThe counter-argument to that seems to be that there are newer coins that do this better.  I do not believe this to be the case.  For example, many tout Solana would be better for this purpose, as its transaction time is nearly instant, compared to Litecoin’s ~2.5 minutes.\n\nIt is true Solana is faster, but its network has gone down on several occasions.  Litecoin has never gone down in its history.  Imagine a government or major corporation finally closing a deal, only for the crypto it planned to use to be completely inoperable at that moment.  \n\nThere is also the proof of stake versus proof of work discussion between the two, as well as Solana not being a fair launch as reasons to prefer Litecoin.\n\nAnd then there’s Ethereum, which I don’t believe compares to Litecoin.  They’re not in competition.  Both can succeed and/or both can fail.  Ethereum is a bet on web3, while Litecoin is a bet on peer-to-peer payments becoming more common.\n\nBesides thinking other coins may do what Litecoin does but better, the only other criticism I see is Litecoin’s founder selling his entire position.  However, this was 8 years ago.  He said he did this to make decisions about Litecoin’s future without taking how those decisions would impact price into consideration.  A convenient thing to say when it was at an ATH.  But this was 8 years ago, and the founder is still leading and adding new features like anonymity, so I don’t believe it matters that he sold his position anymore.  He has continued to act in the coin’s best interest, add features, and remain active to date.\n\nAnother common criticism is that it’s just traded sideways for so long.  But I thought past performance is not predictive of future results?  There is still reason for, and the possibility of, big money adoption that I laid out above.  An ETF seems to be on the horizon.  The tech simply works without issue.  The fact that it has traded sideways is an opportunity, not a criticism.\n\nSo I ask, why don’t you invest in Litecoin?  What would you recommend I read to understand why I’m wrong?  I’m truly open to learning and do not claim to be an expert in this stuff.  But after all the research I’ve tried to do on my own so far, I haven’t really been able to convince myself it’s not a good investment.",
